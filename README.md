**Windows optimization tools designed to maximize system performance through registry tweaks, service management, and system cleanup. Perfect for gamers and power users seeking maximum hardware efficiency.**

</div>

> [!WARNING]
> In the current state of Windows with all the different hardware, software, and configurations people run, it's impossible to create a utility that suits every user's needs out of the box. That's why every feature is fully documented both in the GUI (? icon in top-right) and the CLI ([H] Help). **Read the documentation before running any features** so you know what to expect and what might not work well with your specific setup.

>  **Tutorial recorded on:** Fresh Windows 11 25H2 → Updated → Installed browser → Restarted - Make sure you have a stable GPU driver installed
